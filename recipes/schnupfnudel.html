        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Schupfnoodle dough and form the Schupfnoodles:</strong>Cook the potatoes in their skins for 25 minutes. Peel while still hot and press through a press. Add the egg, egg yolk, salt and spices and knead by hand. Mix cornstarch with flour. Then mix in the mixture until the dough is no longer sticky. Form rolls approx. 1 cm thick from the dough and cut off pieces approx. 3 cm in size. From each piece of dough, form approx. 5 cm of pointed Schupfnudel at the ends between the palms of your hands.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook noodles:</strong>Cook the Schupfnudeln in slightly boiling salted water until they float to the surface. Remove with a ladle and let drain.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare sauerkraut:</strong>Peel the onions and finely dice them. Cut the beef ham into fine cubes. Heat the oil in a saucepan and sauté the chopped onions and finely diced bacon. Add the sauerkraut and sauté as well. Sprinkle with sugar and let caramelize. Add broth and apple juice. Fry the cabbage for a few minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly browned. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.</li>
            <li><strong>Sear:</strong>Heat the butter in a pan and fry the Schupfnudeln in it until they have colour. Mix in the cabbage and season again to taste.</li>
        </ol>
